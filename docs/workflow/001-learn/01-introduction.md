# Introduction

Welcome to DeepSquare, a pioneering force in the decentralized cloud space that revolutionizes access to [High Performance Computing (HPC)](/workflow/learn/core-concepts#high-performance-computing-hpc) resources! Our mission is to make the power of [supercomputers](/workflow/learn/core-concepts#supercomputing) universally accessible, and DeepSquare do this by delivering a simple, modern, and affordable solution.

DeepSquare aggregates the unique capabilities of supercomputers from diverse compute providers worldwide into a unified computational infrastructure known as the [DeepSquare Grid](/workflow/learn/core-concepts#deepsquare-grid). Our primary aim is to democratize HPC, and the Grid stands as a powerful embodiment of this commitment.

DeepSquare operates with a user-centric approach to resource allocation. Users specify the computational requirements for their workloads, and DeepSquare, through its [Meta-scheduling](/workflow/learn/core-concepts#meta-scheduling) process, matches these workloads to the most appropriate compute provider available on the grid.
