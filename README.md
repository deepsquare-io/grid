# The DeepSquare Grid

## Overview

This repository is where [DeepSquare](https://deepsquare.io) develops the Grid. DeepSquare aggregates the unique capabilities of supercomputers from diverse compute providers worldwide into a unified computational infrastructure known as the [DeepSquare Grid](https://docs.deepsquare.run/workflow/learn/core-concepts#deepsquare-grid). Our primary aim is to democratize HPC, and the Grid stands as a powerful embodiment of this commitment.

DeepSquare operates with a user-centric approach to resource allocation. Users specify the computational requirements for their workloads, and DeepSquare, through its [Meta-scheduling](https://docs.deepsquare.run/workflow/learn/core-concepts#meta-scheduling) process, matches these workloads to the most appropriate compute provider available on the grid.

## Key features

With the rise of Machine Learning, DeepSquare is your gateway to the world of High-Performance Computing:

- **Global HPC Network**: DeepSquare Grid aggregates supercomputers from diverse global providers.
- **Democratized HPC**: DeepSquare Grid provides access to any users with specific computational requirements.
- **Tailored Resource Allocation:** DeepSquare Grid allows you to precise your workload's computational requirements, and let DeepSquare's Meta-Scheduling process find the perfect compute provider on the grid.
- **Effortless Efficiency:** Whether you're a scientist, researcher, or engineer, DeepSquare ensures your projects run smoothly and efficiently on cutting-edge HPC infrastructure.
- **Simplified Job Submission:** DeepSquare offers a straightforward API to launch various job types, including MPI and containers on the complex scheduler SLURM, abstracting the infrastructure and software complexity for many users.
