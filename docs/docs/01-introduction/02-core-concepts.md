# Core concepts

## Meta-scheduling

Meta-scheduling to be a technique for coordinating and optimizing the scheduling of jobs or tasks across multiple distributed computing resources, such as clusters or grids.

Meta-scheduling involves using a higher-level scheduler to manage lower-level schedulers, which are responsible for allocating resources and scheduling jobs on individual machines or clusters. The higher-level scheduler may take into account various factors such as job priority, resource availability, and network latency to make decisions about where to schedule tasks.

In other words, meta-scheduling is a way to orchestrate the scheduling of tasks across multiple resources to maximize efficiency, minimize idle time, and avoid conflicts or bottlenecks. It can be particularly useful in environments where there are many competing demands for resources or where the resources themselves are dynamic and may come and go over time.

## Infrastructure providers

Infrastructure providers are organizations or companies that provide computing resources, such as servers, storage, or network bandwidth, for use by other entities, such as businesses or individuals. These providers typically offer their resources on a pay-per-use or subscription basis and may also provide additional services like security, monitoring, and maintenance.

In the context of the DeepSquare ecosystem, infrastructure providers play a crucial role in supporting the DeepSquare grid, which is a distributed computing platform that enables users to run complex computational tasks across a network of connected resources. When an infrastructure provider joins the DeepSquare grid, they make their resources available to other users on the network, allowing them to take advantage of the provider's computing power and storage capacity.

As part of the DeepSquare ecosystem, infrastructure providers may be subject to certain requirements or guidelines to ensure the security, reliability, and performance of the network. For example, they may need to adhere to specific hardware or software configurations, provide regular updates and maintenance, and maintain strict security protocols to protect against data breaches or other threats.

By joining the DeepSquare grid as infrastructure providers, organizations can benefit from increased exposure to potential customers and revenue streams, as well as access to a wider network of computing resources and expertise. At the same time, they play a critical role in supporting the ongoing development and growth of the DeepSquare ecosystem, helping to drive innovation and advance the state of distributed computing.
