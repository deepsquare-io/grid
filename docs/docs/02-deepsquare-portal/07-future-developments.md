# Transforming the Customer Portal into DeepSquare Nexus

The existing portal, which features simple apps showcasing DeepSquare capabilities, is evolving into the DeepSquare Nexus. The Nexus will serve as a dedicated platform for projects built on DeepSquare, showcasing a wide range of applications.

As a central reference point, the DeepSquare Nexus will be the hub for all apps leveraging DeepSquare's HPC capabilities. Its goal is to unite the community by bringing together developers, users, and advanced HPC resources in a single, cohesive ecosystem.

In summary, the DeepSquare Customer Portal and the upcoming DeepSquare Nexus are powerful tools that enable users to fully leverage DeepSquare infrastructure capabilities in a simple, intuitive, and collaborative way.
