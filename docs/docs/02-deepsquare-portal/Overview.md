# DeepSquare Customer Portal

The DeepSquare Customer Portal is a web-based application that allows users to run various computational applications on the DeepSquare infrastructure. Accessible at [app.deepsquare.run](app.deepsquare.run), the portal provides a user-friendly interface enabling users to easily select and launch different applications.

Currently, the DeepSquare Customer Portal offers several pre-built applications, including Text to Image, Blender, Unity Render Streaming, and AI Upscaling. These applications are optimized to run on DeepSquare infrastructure, delivering high performance and scalability.

Besides the pre-built applications, the DeepSquare Customer Portal features a Developer App where users can create and run their customized workflows in an HPC environment. This app offers flexibility for users to develop and run their applications on DeepSquare infrastructure using their preferred programming languages and frameworks.

# Transforming the Customer Portal into DeepSquare Nexus

The existing portal, which features simple apps showcasing DeepSquare capabilities, is evolving into the DeepSquare Nexus. The Nexus will serve as a dedicated platform for projects built on DeepSquare, showcasing a wide range of applications.

As a central reference point, the DeepSquare Nexus will be the hub for all apps leveraging DeepSquare's HPC capabilities. Its goal is to unite the community by bringing together developers, users, and advanced HPC resources in a single, cohesive ecosystem.

In summary, the DeepSquare Customer Portal and the upcoming DeepSquare Nexus are powerful tools that enable users to fully leverage DeepSquare infrastructure capabilities in a simple, intuitive, and collaborative way.
