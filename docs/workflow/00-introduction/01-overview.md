# DeepSquare Overview

Welcome to DeepSquare, a pioneering force in the decentralized cloud space that revolutionizes access to [High Performance Computing (HPC)](/workflow/introduction/core-concepts#high-performance-computing-hpc) resources. Our mission is to make the power of [supercomputers](/workflow/introduction/core-concepts#supercomputing) universally accessible, and DeepSquare do this by delivering a simple, modern, and affordable solution.

DeepSquare aggregates the unique capabilities of supercomputers from diverse compute providers worldwide into a unified computational infrastructure known as the [DeepSquare Grid](/workflow/introduction/core-concepts#deepsquare-grid). Our primary aim is to democratize HPC, and the Grid stands as a powerful embodiment of this commitment.

DeepSquare operates with a user-centric approach to resource allocation. Users specify the computational requirements for their workloads, and DeepSquare, through its [Meta-scheduling](/workflow/introduction/core-concepts#meta-scheduling) process, matches these workloads to the most appropriate compute provider available on the grid.

Our platform caters to a broad spectrum of computational requirements. Whether you're a scientist conducting complex simulations or a startup in need of scalable computational resources, DeepSquare brings the power of HPC within your reach, simplifying access and use of supercomputing capabilities.

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using DeepSquare's services. It explains how to:

- Run jobs on the DeepSquare Grid via our [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepsquare/deepsquare-client) or the [customer portal](https://app.deepsquare.run/). A detailed '[Getting Started](/workflow/getting-started/introduction)' section is included to guide you through the process of executing optimized HPC workloads. Further, we have made available multiple guides and workflow file samples for practical reference.
- [Join the grid as a compute provider](/deepsquare-grid/join/overview), detailing the process and requirements.
- Become a blockchain validator, providing insights into the specific role and its technical aspects within the DeepSquare ecosystem.

Whether you're a new user looking to understand the basics or an existing user aiming for deeper technical comprehension, this guide serves to provide the knowledge and tools needed to effectively utilize the DeepSquare decentralized HPC ecosystem.
