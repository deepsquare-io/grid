# TypeScript

The TypeScript version of the SDK permits you to write browser or server-side code to send jobs to the DeepSquare Grid. Whether you are building a website that launches a parallelized deep learning training, or you are implementing an API, the DeepSquare TypeScript SDK provides you with the tools and flexibility needed to develop software using the DeepSquare Grid.

## Getting started

The package is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepsquare/deepsquare-client). You can use your favorite package manager to install the SDK:

```shell
npm install @deepsquare/deepsquare-client
# OR
pnpm add @deepsquare/deepsquare-client
# OR
yarn add @deepsquare/deepsquare-client
# OR
bun install @deepsquare/deepsquare-client
```

Since the DeepSquare client use [Viem](https://viem.sh), a lightweight, type-safe Ethereum runtime, install it with:

```shell
npm install viem
# OR
pnpm add viem
# OR
yarn add viem
# OR
bun install viem
```

You can use it in your project like this:

```ts
import DeepSquareClient, { FormatJobStatus, isJobTerminated } from '@deepsquare/deepsquare-client';
import { Hex, parseEther } from 'viem';

async function main() {
  // Instantiate the DeepSquareClient
  const deepSquareClient = new DeepSquareClient(
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex,
    undefined,
    process.env.METASCHEDULER_ADDR as Hex,
  );

  // Worflow
  const myJob = {
    resources: {
      tasks: 1,
      gpus: 0,
      cpusPerTask: 1,
      memPerCpu: 1024,
    },
    enableLogging: true,
    steps: [
      {
        name: 'hello world',
        run: {
          command: 'echo "Hello World"',
        },
      },
    ],
  };

  // 'Allowance' lets DeepSquare use a set amount of your tokens to pay for jobs, like a spending limit.
  // DeepSquare can only use up to the limit you set, ensuring control and security over your wallet.
  const depositAmount = parseEther('1000');
  await deepSquareClient.setAllowance(depositAmount);

  // Launch the job
  // The 'credits' specify how much of your allowance is used for a particular job. For instance,
  // if you set an allowance of 1000 and use 100 credits for a job, you'll still have 900 in allowance
  // for future jobs, no need to set a new allowance until your total credits exceed it.
  const credits = parseEther('1000');
  const jobId = await deepSquareClient.submitJob(myJob, 'myJob', credits);
}

main();
```
