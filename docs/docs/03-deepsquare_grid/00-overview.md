# Overview

The **DeepSquare Grid** is a network of server clusters forming the pool of compute required to process users' workloads.
We love to call it the meta-cluster.

Our mission is to create an **inclusive decentralised compute ecosystem**, and we believe infrastructure decentralisation must be achieved both geographically and in terms of governance/ownership.  
This is why we developed a set of mechanisms and open source software to incentivise IT infrastructure owners to join the Grid.
