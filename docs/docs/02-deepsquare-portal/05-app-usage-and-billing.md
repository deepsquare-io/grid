# Billing in DeepSquare Portal

Billing in the DeepSquare portal is based on credit tokens that you allocate for each job. This guide will help you understand how to manage your credit allocation, avoid job failures due to insufficient credits, and make the most of the platform's features.

## Credit Allocation

When submitting a job, you'll need to specify the number of credit tokens you want to allocate for it in the **Credit Allocation** field. It's better to allocate more tokens than less to avoid job failures due to insufficient credits. The tokens allocated for a job are locked during the entire job process. Once the job is complete, any leftover tokens will be returned to your account.

## Estimating Credit Allocation

Determining the appropriate amount of credit allocation can be challenging. You can refer to the **Credit Cost per Minute** information provided just before the payment section. For the time it takes to finish the job, it's up to you to estimate. For applications like **Text 2 Image** that have a constant cost, you can visit the **Job Status** page to see the cost of the job.

## Crypto Allowance

When using DeepSquare, you will need to set a **crypto allowance** for the platform. This is the maximum amount of cryptocurrency you authorize the platform to spend on your behalf for services provided.

Setting a predefined allowance allows you to streamline the payment process by preventing your wallet, such as MetaMask or other crypto wallets, from prompting you to confirm an "increase-allowance" transaction every time you use the platform's services.

To set a crypto allowance:

1. Connect your wallet to the DeepSquare platform.
2. Click on your _balance_ in the header section.
3. Enter the amount of tokens you wish to authorize for the platform to use.
4. Confirm the transaction.

Once the allowance is set, DeepSquare can automatically deduct tokens from your wallet to pay for services, up to the specified allowance amount. Make sure to set an allowance that corresponds to the amount you agree the platform can take from your wallet, to avoid any disruptions in service due to insufficient funds.

If you need to increase or decrease your allowance, simply follow the same steps and enter a new allowance amount.

## Top-Up Credits

If you didn't allocate enough credits initially, you can add more tokens to a running job by clicking the **Top-Up** button on the **Job Status** page.

## Auto Top-Up Mode (Coming soon)

You can enable **Auto Top-Up** mode to let the platform automatically add credits to your job and keep it running until your wallet runs out of funds. Make sure to set an allowance that corresponds to the amount you agree the platform can take from your wallet. Otherwise, your job may fail due to insufficient credits despite having available funds in your wallet.

By understanding and managing your credit allocation and billing, you can efficiently use the DeepSquare portal and avoid unexpected job failures.
