# About modules

Modules are reusable group of steps that can be shared between different workflows. They can help developers save time and reduce errors by automating common tasks and integrating with popular tools.

The modular feature allows developers to discover and use pre-built custom group of steps that have been created and shared by other members of the community. These modules can be easily integrated into a workflow by simply referencing them in a "use" step. The community aspect of this feature means that developers can benefit from the collective expertise of other developers and find solutions to problems they may not have encountered before.
