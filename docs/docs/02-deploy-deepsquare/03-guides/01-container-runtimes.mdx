# Using container runtimes

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The container runtime is software that makes it easy to create, manage and destroy containers. Common container runtimes are [containerd](https://containerd.io), [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)(the Docker runtime) or [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun)(the Podman runtime).

While these runtimes meet the OCI specifications perfectly, we have some requirements to optimize for task scheduling in a HPC environment:

- Rootless and privilege-free by default
- GPU and MPI compatible
- No performance overhead, no network overhead

Apptainer and Enroot are the standards container runtimes in HPC.

## Apptainer

Apptainer, also known as Singularity, defaults to integration over isolation, making it easier to integrate GPUs and high-speed networks. It also mounts the container image as a read-only file system by default.

Apptainer downloads and extracts the layers from the container and builds a Singularity Image Format (SIF) file from the extracted layers. Then, Apptainer can mount the SIF file and run the container entrypoint.

One of the main features of apptainer is the ability to load an "unpacked" container image. In fact, it can load the rootfs of a container image from a directory. Coupled with CVMFS, the distributed file system with aggressive caching, apptainer is able to **download the container files dynamically** without having to download the entire container. This is very useful when the container is filled with a large number of files that are useless at runtime. This is basically a Just-in-time file loading.

DeepSquare-hosted images are shared and executed across every clusters in this manner.

## Enroot

Although apptainer fits most use cases, the default DeepSquare runtime is Enroot.

Enroot is incredibly simpler than apptainer and is maintained by NVIDIA. Enroot uses hooks to embed devices on containers, and mount the container image with write permissions.

Enroot extracts layers and creates a squashfs file from the extracted layers. Then, Enroot can extract the squashfs file to a runtime directory and execute the container entry point. As a result, Enroot can mount the rootfs from any squashfs.

Since the behavior is very similar to Docker while being dead simple, this is the reason why DeepSquare chose Enroot as the default container runtime.

## Using Enroot and/or Apptainer locally

### Installation

Enroot and Apptainer can be both installed easily from their releases:

- [Enroot Github Latest Release](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot/releases/latest) and [install guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot/blob/master/doc/installation.md)
- [Apptainer Github Latest Release](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/releases/latest) and [install guide](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

### Building an image for Enroot and Apptainer

There are a lot of ways to build a container image for Enroot and Apptainer.

You can :

- Build a squashfs file from scratch.
- Build a SIF using a [Apptainer Definition File](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/definition_files.html)
- Use Buildah/Podman/Docker to build a Docker image.

We **highly recommend** Podman to build a Docker image.

For this guide, we will build a simple hello world:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM alpine

ENTRYPOINT [ "echo", "hello world" ]
```

```shell title="user@~/examples/"
podman build -t localhost/hello-world .
```

:::note

Enroot and Apptainer can execute the entrypoint. However, the implementation on DeepSquare doesn't execute the entrypoint when filling the `command` field.

The entrepoint must be re-specified. In this example, the value of the `command` field would be `echo "hello world"`.

### Testing locally

While the Podman have similar constraints to those of enroot (rootless, unprivileged, uid map), you may want to test on Enroot or Apptainer.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Enroot" value="enroot">

```shell title="user@~/examples/"
# Pull the image
enroot import --output "localhost+hello-world+latest.sqsh" "podman://localhost/hello-world:latest"
# enroot can also pull from the Docker daemon with dockerd:// or from a Docker registry with docker://
enroot create --name "localhost+hello-world+latest" "localhost+hello-world+latest.sqsh"

# Run the image
enroot start localhost+hello-world+latest

# Remove the image
enroot remove "localhost+hello-world+latest"
rm "localhost+hello-world+latest.sqsh"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Apptainer" value="apptainer">

```shell title="user@~/examples/"
# Pull the image
podman save localhost/hello-world:latest -o "localhost+hello-world+latest.tar"
apptainer build "localhost+hello-world+latest.sif" "docker-archive://localhost+hello-world+latest.tar"
# If using Docker, you can directly build from the Daemon and avoid "docker save" using:
# apptainer build "localhost+hello-world+latest.sif" "docker-daemon://localhost/hello-world:latest"
# You can also pull an image from a registry with "docker://".

# Run the image (the image is run in read-only mode, and therefore doesn't need a runtime directory)
apptainer run "localhost+hello-world+latest.sif"

# Remove the image
rm "localhost+hello-world+latest.sif"
rm "localhost+hello-world+latest.tar"
```

## Examples of usage with DeepSquare

If your container works with podman, enroot and/or apptainer, your probability of success is very high for running on DeepSquare!

To run a container on DeepSquare, you must distribute your image on a Container Registry like the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) or with a self-hosting solution like [Harbor](https://goharbor.io).

You can also use S3 to host your squashfs/SIF file and use the Workflow `input` field to extract the image... but this is much more complicated than [deploying a registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) or just pushing on a public registry like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
