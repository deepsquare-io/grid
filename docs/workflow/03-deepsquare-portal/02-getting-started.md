# Quick start

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of setting up your account and launching applications on the DeepSquare Customer Portal.

## Setting up a Crypto Wallet

Before using the portal, you need to set up a crypto wallet to manage your credits. We recommend using either [MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) or [Core Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/core-crypto-wallet-nft-ex/agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb).

## Acquiring Free Credits

To get started, you can acquire some free credits by applying through our [form](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1PVlRXYdMSdy-iBH_PXx_0wev6gi).

## Using the DeepSquare Customer Portal

1. **Choose an app**: On the left panel, select an application from the available options: Media Upscaling, Text 2 Image, Blender, Unity Render Streaming, or the Dev app.
2. **Configure the app**: Fill in the required fields on the app configuration page.
3. **Set credit token amount**: Allocate the amount of credit tokens for your job. Keep in mind that the more credits you allocate, the longer the job will run before running out of credits.
4. **Name your job**: Assign a name to your job.
5. **Submit your job**: Click the 'Submit' button to launch your job. Your crypto wallet (MetaMask or Core Wallet) will prompt you to confirm the transaction.

It's important to note that the DeepSquare Customer Portal uses a pay-as-you-go model. Any unused credits will be refunded to your account after the job is completed.
